# Antlia
A collection of functions for [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/).

Antlia makes it easier to use geometry, coloring and interactivity inside Hydra. It also adds easy-access image use and extra 'Math' functions.

## How to use

As of now, the only way to use Antlia is to open Hydra on [your browser](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/) or [Atom](https://github.com/ojack/atom-hydra) and run the [main code](https://github.com/ritchse/hydra-antlia/blob/master/antlia.js); once evaluated, you are free to remove the code and start coding.
Remember that you can Ctrl+A+Supr!

## Why Antlia?
If you're wondering about the name, *Antlia* is the south-bordering constelation of *Hydra*. If you're wondering why I made Antlia, here it is:

* **Doing geometric stuff in pure Hydra can get really tedious.** And it makes sense, after all Hydra is inspired by analog modular synthesizers. I started Antlia after trying to draw some flags inside Hydra and realizing how the analog-signal way of thinking it's so counter intuitive for that specific goal.
* **I barely know JavaScript**, so having to search for [an example of using images in Hydra](https://gist.github.com/munshkr/a4c280240bfd07a9819c1218d3952571) because I don't know nothing about JavaScript classes felt like losing time.
* **I want to code more, think less.** Having to think mathematically about the Math functions can get frustrating when you don't get the expected results, same goes with trying to form RGB colors inside your head.
* **I love colors.** I love colors.
* **Interacting with Hydra with mouse and keyboard is so fun,** it feels like a superpower, so I wanted to make it easier to achieve that.

## Starting to use the Antlia functions

As I said in the [How to use](#How-to-use) section, to start using Antlia you'll need to evaluate the [main code](https://github.com/ritchse/hydra-antlia/blob/master/antlia.js) inside Hydra. But, if you don't care much about geometry and color, you can also refer to the [file that excludes those features](https://github.com/ritchse/hydra-antlia/blob/master/math-interactive-img.js).

**You can find documentation for every Antlia feature in [here](https://github.com/ritchse/hydra-antlia/blob/master/funcs.md)**

### Endnote
Feel free to make new functions and send the pull requests, or just tell me about your ideas. Also, remember that sharing to [@hydra_patterns](https://twitter.com/hydra_patterns) using Antlia won't make much sense since people won't be able to evaluate your code if they don't know what Antlia is, so just keep that in mind. Love.
